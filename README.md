I dont remember the full parameters of the assignment. but this is more or less what it is. 

Remember to copy CreditCardData.txt into bin/debug or bin/release

Remember... theres alot of ways to do the same thing (:

**notes**
* There is one part i misinterpreted from the extra credit. The correct way was to have the
bank report print out a summary for all banks in one document. I did one summary per bank. This has 
been corrected. (to view the submitted version, check tags for the "submitted" version or commit history)

* You were allowed to remove the header row and empty rows at the end of the CreditCardData.txt. This
version will accept the original final and properly ignores them
